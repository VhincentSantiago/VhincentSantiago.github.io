## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 10

    In Lab 10, there were 2 parts. The first was using double vectors to try and find counties and their population. It was really fun to use double vectors, and by far my favorite lab. In part-2 we found out how to find the densest and sparest state which was also very fun.

* Lab 8

    In Lab 8 we calculated the Olympic judges' score average in part-1 and in part-2 we created a pattern. In part-1 I liked how we had to get values and add it back into a variable using +=. That was really fun and interesting to me, but in part-2 creating the pattern was fun and silly. Which makes this another one of my favorite labs.

* Lab 7 

    Now Lab 7 only had 1 part, but it was very interactive and different. We had to calculate parking, basically deciding what times you can park on this spot and what times you cannot. We had images in the README.md file and we had to incorporate that into our code. To me this was a very creative lab and it was very fun.
